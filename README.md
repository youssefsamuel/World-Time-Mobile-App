A simple mobile application to get the current time all over the world.
Using flutter, and dart programming language.
This app consists of three main screens:
1. Loading Screen: To get the time of the location selected using WorldTimeAPI (http://worldtimeapi.org/)
2. Home Screen: To display to the user the location name, current time with a background image showing whether it is day or night, and finally a button to be able to change the location.
3. Changing Location Screen: To display a list of all the locations available in this app sorted alphabetically, and the user can select anyone of them to be redirected to the home page.
